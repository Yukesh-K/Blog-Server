The actor, who is otherwise known for his romantic image, is playing a local gangster in the period film. The trailer gives a sneak peek into the film’s story where DQ’s Raju aspires to be a gangster or the ‘King of Kotha’, just like his father. He grows up to be “the people’s hero” who has Kotha under his thumb and is also an alcoholic. Pleasing his fans, Dulquer also has a romantic track in the film with Aishwarya Lekshmi. It appears that the film’s plot centers around drug trade in Kotha and how Raju and opposing gang members are at loggerheads about the same. The film has all the elements of a mass entertainer and could be the next pan-Indian hit for Dulquer",

Like the Wick saga, Reeves and Stahelski will make Cipher for Lionsgate. Cipher will be part of the same action genre as the John Wick flicks, though from the logline it’s clear Keanu Reeves won’t be playing the same kind of tortured assassin.

In Groves’ mind, keeping his various teams walled off from one another will help ensure the strictest secrecy. But J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the brilliant theoretical physicist he’s hired to run the project laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M., knows that compartmentalization has its limits. The success of their mission will hinge not on isolation but on an extraordinary collaborative synthesis — of physics and chemistry, theory and practice, science and the military, the professional and the personal.

Seeing as Microsoft doesn't actually own Activision yet, it also isn't very surprising that the game is coming to PlayStation consoles (plus, Sony has signed a deal so that the series will stay on its platform for a while longer). But Activision and PlayStation are seemingly keeping their close relationship together for the time being, as it was recently spotted by Call of Duty news account CharlieIntel that Modern Warfare 3's beta will be on PlayStation first (thanks, Eurogamer).",

But there is a big caveat. The Huawei Watch 4 is claimed to help with the tracking of a user’s blood sugar levels. I am not sure what exactly that means, but Huawei did confirm that it is not equal to tracking blood sugar levels (via 9to5Google). Essentially, Huawei’s new smartwatch comes with a feature called hyperglycemic risk assessment. This feature uses the watch’s sensors to detect abnormal blood sugar levels to warn you whether or not you are in the danger zone. The watch utilises a “micro-physical examination function” that can measure 10 vital signs within 60 seconds. Using these signs, the watch determines whether the blood sugar level could be high or not.",
